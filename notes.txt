JavaScript is used to program the behavior of webpage.
We don't need to download JavaScript it is already running in our browser, computer, table, smart phone.
WHAT CAN JAVASCRIPT DO?
- it can change HTML content (target.innerHTML = `${newInnerHtml}`)
- it can change HTML attribute values (target.attributeName = 'newAttributeValue';)
- it can change HTML style (CSS) (target.style.propName = 'valueName';)
- it can hide HTML elements (target.visibility = 'hidden';)
- it can show HTML elements (target.visibility = 'visible';)
JavaScript is written inside the <script> tags
<scipt> tag can be place in <head> and well as in the <body>
Have <script> tag as the last element of the <body> element so that script is executed after the HTML has been rendered. It also improves the display speed, because script execution can slow down display.
Advantages of using external JavaScript:
- separate HTML and JavaScript
- makes HTML and JavaScript easy to read and maintain
- cached JavaScript files can speed up page loads
How to reference external JavaScripts
- with a full URL
- with a file path
- without any path
Display Possibilities:
- innerHTML (to access modify HTML)
- document.write() (using it after HTML has been loaded with delete existing HTML)
- window.alert() (window keyword can be skipped)
- console.log() (for logging into the console)
- window.print() (for print the content of the current window)
JavaScript ignores multiple white spaces.
Types of values: literals and varialbles
Expression is a combination of literals, varialbles and operators
// for single line comment
/* */ for multi line comments
Variable Naming Rules
- can contains letters, digits, $, _
- can't start with digits
SQL is a non case sensitive programming language
Variables can be declared with var, let or const
Use const for constants
Use let in general
Avoid var
Identifiers are names of Variables and functions
We can declare and initialize many variable in one statement.
Variable declared without a value is assigned undefined
Variables declared with Var
- have global scope
- can be redeclared
- can updated
Variable declared with Let
- have block scope
- cannot be redeclared
- can be updated
Variables declared with Const
- have block scope
- cannot be redeclared
- cannot be updated
- must be initialized at the time of declaration
We can change the elements of a constant array
We can change the properties of a constant object
* and / have higher predence than + and -
Datatypes
- number
- null
- string
- symbol
- bigint
- boolean
- undefined
- object
Object Datatype acn contain
- object
- array
- date
Adding a number and a string returns a string
JavaScript numbers are always one type double (64 bit floating point)
typeOf operator
Parameters are listed inside the parenthesis in function definition
Arguments are the values that are received by the function when it was invoked
When a function reaches a return statement, it stops executing
The () operator invokes the function
Variables declared inside a function become local to the function
